Are you a glutton for punishment? Or do you secretly love being Rick Rolled?
No judgement here, but this extension might come in handy for you!

Whenever you visit a YouTube page, you'll have a 1 in N chance of having
the video element replaced with a Rick Roll. The value of N is 6 by default
but you can configure this to whatever number you choose.
